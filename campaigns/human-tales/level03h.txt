Commander Sinclair, servant of Baron Jadeite,
To Acting Commander of the Blardneg Frontier Forces:

Salutations and congratulations, brother. News has reached us of your accomplishments at Dunath Outpost. The Lord Baron is thankful that you have not let him down.

Your new orders are to advance to Port Seth. Commandeer any resources available and construct a fleet capable of meeting this new threat. The Mythic Imperial Navy have a store there filled with gunpowder and cannon. Using these weapons you will be more than equipped to decimate these renegades.

May you continue fulfilling the will of the Baron.
