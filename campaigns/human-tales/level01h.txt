Commander Sinclair, servant of Baron Jadeite,

To Acting Commander of the Blardneg Frontier Forces:

The Lord Baron has heard disturbing rumours that a band of rebel marauders have been harassing travellers in the Seawill Forest.

You have been tasked with visiting the Seawill lumbermill to see if there is any truth to these rumours.

Be aware that the Baron has no need for traitors. If these rumours are confirmed to be true, you are to bring a swift end to any renegades you encounter.

May you fulfil the will of the Baron.
