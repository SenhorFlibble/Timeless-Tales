Grand Master Seth, servant of the Black Fox of Abel,
To Brother Commander of the Blardneg Chapter:

Salutations and goodwill commander. I hope you and your brothers have arrived well in the Blardnegs.

Years ago the Mythics outlawed magic. They feared the peasantry would one day rise up and threatened their position. Now they've taken this policy further and have outlawed possession of gunpowder and other weapons. Clearly the Mythics are becoming increasingly mindful of a revolution.

The council has decided that the time to act is now. The peasantry is more disillusioned than ever, and we must capitalise on the unrest within the Mythic territories to enable our influence to spread. When this letter reaches you, Brother Commander Armon, would have begun his assault on Baron Jadeite's castle.

Your first quest shall be to influence a number of homesteads on the frontier. Their support and coin will be useful in aiding us on our pilgrimage. Be award that an unknown enemy has been harassing these farmsteads, and have caused the Mythic militia their to abandon their posts.

For this task, mages learned in the ways of constructing crystal golems have been dispatched to you. Our brothers may project their minds into these vessels to wage battle against our enemies.

I wish you success, and may you continue to search the path.
