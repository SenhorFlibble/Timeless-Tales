# Timeless Tales
Timeless Tales is a stand-alone fantasy real-time strategy (RTS) game that runs on the <a href="https://stratagus.com/">Stratagus engine</a>. It is based on the earlier <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/aleona/index.html">Aleona's Tales</a> project and was originally developed by Kyran Jackson, who came up with and coded in many new game modes and experimented with an enhanced adventure/campaign mode. That version of Timeless Tales has not been updated since 2016 and is not easy to set up and run, as it requires external files from a specific old version of <a href="https://github.com/Andrettin/Wyrmsun/">Wyrmsun</a>, a different game on the Stratagus engine. Even with the proper version of WYrmsun data, Timeless Tales does not work out of the box.

The present fork removes these external dependencies, and also updates some of the artwork, including newer sprite sheets originating from the Wyrmsun project.
