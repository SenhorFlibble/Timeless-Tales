Major Ryder, leader of Deadrock,
To the Commander of the Order encampment: 

Greetings from the people of Deadrock. Your presence here fills our hearts with hope.

Our Baron has withdrawn all his forces to the defence of Genesis Castle. The Royal Navy has also withdrawn, abandoning us for the safety of the sea. We were left with instructions to block the canal to prevent the enemy from sailing further inland. 

Unfortunately, the enemy have returned and have established new encampments on the opposite side of the canal. They are keeping to themselves, however, my rangers inform me that an evil witch, Zoey Ballbuster, has been spotted in their village. She hates our peaceful village, and is no doubt poisoning the mind of their chieftain. We must take action and prepare if Deadrock is to survive. It is only a matter of time before convinces him to turn his attention to us.

May victory come swift to us.
