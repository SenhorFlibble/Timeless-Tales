Commander Sinclair, servant of Baron Jadeite,
To Acting Commander of the Blardneg Frontier Forces:

The Lord Baron is not displeased with your efforts in the Blardnegs. However, the situation has been deteriorating here on the mainland.

You shall immediately set sail for the small fishing village located at Deadrock. The enemy have infested both sides of the canal there, and must be eliminated. Once you have destroyed the enemy on your side of the embankment the Mythic Imperial Navy will be able to enter to canal and commence bombardment of the remaining enemy forces.

Once bombardment has commenced you are to return here to aid in the defence of Genesis Castle.

May you continue fulfilling the will of the Baron.
